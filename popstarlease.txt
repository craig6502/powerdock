Other obligations under this Lease may also be essential terms.14.2	Lessor's right to terminate<h3>The Lessor may terminate this Lease by giving the Lessee notice or by re-entering the Premises without notice and excluding the Lessee if the Lessee:<h4>repudiates its obligations under this Lease;<h4>does not comply with an essential term of this Lease; or<h4>does not comply with an obligation under this Lease (which is not an essential term) and, in the Lessor's reasonable opinion:<tab><tab>(A)<tab>the non-compliance can be remedied, but the Lessee does not remedy it within a reasonable time after the Lessor gives the Lessee notice to remedy it;<tab><tab>(B)<tab>the non-compliance cannot be remedied or compensated for; or<tab><tab>(C)<tab>the non-compliance cannot be remedied but the Lessor can be compensated and the Lessee does not pay the Lessor compensation for the breach within a reasonable time after the Lessor gives the Lessee notice to pay it,<p>except that when section 81(1) of the Property Law Act 1969 applies, the Lessor may only terminate this Lease if the Lessor has given the Lessee a notice complying with that section and the Lessee has failed to comply with the notice.<h3>If this Lease is terminated under this clause 16:<h4>the Lessee indemnifies the Lessor against any liability or loss arising and any cost incurred (whether before or after termination of this Lease) in connection with the Lessee's breach of this Lease and the termination of this Lease including the Lessor's loss of the benefit of the Lessee performing its obligations under this Lease from the date of that termination until the Expiry Date; andthe Lessor must take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss.<h3>If the Lessee vacates or abandons the Premises or otherwise repudiates this Lease, the Lessor may (but is not obliged) to find another tenant and for that purpose the Lessor may enter the Premises and do all other things incidental or necessary to relet the Premises without accepting or being deemed to have accepted a surrender or repudiation of this Lease.

The Lessee is deemed to have vacated the Premises if it ceases to carry on the Lessee's Business for 7 days without having paid in advance the Rent, Turnover Rent and the Lessee's Share of the Outgoings.<h2>Interest on overdue money<p>If the Lessee does not pay any amount payable by the Lessee under this Lease on time, the Lessee must pay interest on that from when the amount become due for payment until the amount is paid.

Interest payable but not paid may be capitalised by the Lessor at monthly intervals and interest is payable on the capitalised interest at the rate and in the manner described in this clause.<h2>Lessor may rectify <h3>If the Lessee fails to pay any moneys to a third party or if the Lessee fails to perform any of its obligations, the Lessor may, as the agent of the Lessee, make any such payment or do all such acts as may be necessary to rectify the failure.<h3>The full amount of any moneys paid by the Lessor and any cost and expense incurred by the Lessor pursuant to clause 16.4(a) will constitute a liquidated debt due and owing by the Lessee to the Lessor and be payable by the Lessee to the Lessor on demand.
